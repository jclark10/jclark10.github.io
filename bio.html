	<h1> -Biography- </h1>
	<p> My name is James Wesley Clark and I was born and raised in Washington, D.C. Both my parents are lawyers and I have an older brother and sister who are out of college. For my education, I spent the first eleven years at a small Catholic school down the street from Georgetown until graduating from there and attending the Potomac School in Mclean for high school. While there, I played soccer, track and cross country. My favorite subjects were Math, Computer Science and History. I am an avid pet lover with two dogs and two cats back home. My favorite pastimes are movies, music and podcasts. </p>
